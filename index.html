            University of Washington regent and chairwoman of United Way
            International. He is raised in Seattle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1967</strong> : - Gates is enrolled in the Lakeside School,
            an exclusive private school in Seattle, where he befriends Paul

          <li>
            <strong>1973</strong> : - Gates enters Harvard as a pre-law major,
            but soon shifts focus. He quickly runs through the university’s most
            rigorous mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1975</strong> : - From his dorm room, Gates calls MITS, the
            maker of the world’s first personal computer. He offers to develop
            software for the MITS Altair. MITS eventually accepts and buys his
            language for $3,000 plus royalties. Gates takes his first leave of
            absence from school to start working on the software venture he
            refers to as Micro-Soft.

          <li>

            “Microsoft.” Gates writes an open letter to computer hobbyists,
            condemning the early adopters for sharing, rather than paying for,
            software.

            to the operating system “DOS” from Seattle Computer Products. The
            system is modified and renamed MS-DOS, and the company licenses it
            to IBM for the company’s new personal computer.

            of Windows 95. The Road Ahead, Gates’ book about his vision for the
            digital future, holds the No. 1 spot on The New York Times
            best-seller list for seven weeks. Gates begins to shift Microsoft’s
            focus toward the emerging Internet.

            practices designed to maintain its monopoly in personal computer
            operating systems and to extend that monopoly to Internet browsing
            software. Twenty state attorneys general and the District of
            Columbia filed a similar action. Later, in October the DOJ also sued
            Microsoft for violating a 1994 consent decree, by forcing computer
            makers to include its Internet browser as a part of the installation
            of Windows software.

            Bono, for what the magazine called his “good Samaritan” work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong> : - Gates “graduates” from Harvard; the
            university awards him with an honorary degree.
          </li>

            <strong>2008</strong> : - Though his fortune continues to grow,
            Gates loses his spot as the richest man on the planet. After 13
            years in the No. 1 spot on the Forbes’ list, Gates’ is surpassed by
            his friend Warren Buffet and Mexican telecom giant Carlos Slim Helu.
            Gates retires from day-to-day duties at Microsoft on June 27, but
            stays in the role of chairman and adviser on important development
            projects. He tells the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that he plans to
            pour the same amount of energy into his foundation that he did into
            Microsoft. He tells the newspaper, “I’m not a sit-on-the-beach
            type.”
